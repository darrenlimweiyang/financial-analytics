# financial-analytics
First try at financial analytics

### hello!

Just taking a crack at some basic financial visualizations here. In this case, I will be focused on the stock prices of a few of the larger banks between 2006 - 2016. 
This is heavily inspired by an Udemy Course by https://www.udemy.com/user/joseportilla/
